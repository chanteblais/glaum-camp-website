// resolver the pages' own gates use, so the nav can never disagree with the
// page about membership (a member resolved via the email fallback used to get
// the public nav on a members-only page). The fallback — currentUser(), which
// Clerk request-caches — only runs on a clerk-id miss; approved members with
// linked rows stay on the indexed fast path, and resolveMember's own
// request-cache still shares the lookup with the page.
