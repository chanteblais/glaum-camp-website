# Feature Map

---

## Navigation

The site uses a single shared `Header` component (`components/HeaderClient.tsx`) on all pages. Nav links switch based on auth + approval state.

**Unauthenticated / not approved:**
```
Glåüm   About · Participate · Schedule · Apply     [Sign in]
```

**Approved members:**
```
Glåüm   Home · Schedule · Many Hands · Messages · My Profile   [🔔 avatar▾]
```

- `Messages` shows an unread count badge (polled every 30s via `/api/messages/unread`)
- Avatar dropdown: Admin link (admin only) + Sign out
- Mobile: hamburger menu with the same contextual links

Nav links for non-approved signed-in users (pending/rejected) show the public set — `/apply` is the only meaningful destination for them.

---

## Public Pages

### Homepage (`/`)

**Who:** Anyone (public view) / Approved members (dashboard view)  
**What:** Two distinct experiences depending on auth state.

**Public (not signed in):**
- TokyoDreams display heading + camp logo
- Hero tagline (`home_tagline` from `page_content`)
- Embedded public schedule (`ScheduleSection` + `ScheduleCalendarClient`)
  - Mobile: day-tab switcher (< 640px)
  - Desktop: 6-column grid
- About + Participate sections (editable via Admin → Edit Page)
- Footer with hands SVG decorations

**Member dashboard (approved + signed in):**

Fixed top sections (always present, not reorderable):
1. **Hero banner** — welcome greeting, countdown to event, hero tagline (`home_tagline`, editable inline)
2. **Attunement + Commitments** — side-by-side (`dash-grid`)

Configurable widgets (order, visibility, and width controlled by admin via the page editor):

| Widget ID | Default label | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `announcements` | Announcements | Visible, non-expired admin announcements; pinned first. Hidden if empty |
| `polls` | Polls | Active, non-expired admin polls. Members vote inline; results shown after voting |
| `events` | Upcoming Gatherings | Pre-camp + at-camp `schedule_events` in the next 14 days. "View full schedule →" links to `/schedule` |
| `spotlight` | Meet a Member | Left: rotating member spotlight (cycles every minute). Right: Upcoming Gatherings list |
| `activity` | Recent Activity | Mixed feed of member joins + profile updates, up to 6 items |

Fixed bottom section (always present):
- **Role & Shift + Many Hands** — quick-link grid to `/signup` and `/members`

**Widget layout:** widgets render in a `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1.25rem` container. Each widget is `flex: 0 0 100%` (full width) by default, or `flex: 0 0 calc(50% - 0.625rem)` (half width) when configured. Two consecutive half-width widgets sit side by side. On mobile (≤ 680px) all widgets revert to full width.

**Dashboard layout** is stored as `dashboard_layout` JSON in `page_content`:
```json
{ "order": ["announcements","polls","events","spotlight","activity"], "hidden": [], "widths": {} }
```

Admin-only: **"✎ Edit Page"** floating button (bottom-right). Clicking enters inline edit mode:
- A top bar appears: `Editing · [+ Poll] [Edit Text] [Save] [✕]`
- All widgets get a gold dashed outline
- Hovering a widget reveals a `⠿ Label [½]` handle in its top-right corner
- **Drag the handle** to reorder widgets — the card physically follows the cursor (`position: fixed`) while a dashed placeholder holds the drop slot
- **Click `½`** on the handle to toggle that widget between full and half width (updates live on the page before saving)
- **Click a gold-underlined text element** (e.g. the hero tagline) to edit it inline (`contenteditable`)
- **`+ Poll`** — opens a slide-in panel to create a new poll
- **`Edit Text`** — opens a slide-in panel for copy fields not visible on the dashboard (quote card, About, Participate)
- **`Save`** — writes new order + widths + any text edits to `page_content` and reloads

---

### Apply (`/apply`)

**Who:** Prospective camp members  
**What:** Multi-step application wizard (`ApplyWizard`) driven by the form config stored in `page_content` (`config_member_form`).

**States:**

| State | Condition | What's shown |
|---|---|---|
| Track picker | Signed in, no application | Choose Member or Volunteer track |
| Wizard | `?track=member` | 6-step (or more) multi-step form |
| Applications closed | `config.open === false` | Closed message |
| Pending / Rejected | `application.status` is `pending` or `rejected` | Redirect to `/profile` |
| Approved | `application.status === 'approved'` | Redirect to `/profile#role-signup` |

**Admin preview:** `?track=member&admin_preview=1` lets admins preview the form even when they already have an approved application. Bypasses redirect checks.

**Wizard steps (default):**

| Step | Key | Title |
|---|---|---|
| I | `basic` | Basic Information |
| II | `registry` | Many Hands Registry |
| III | `plans` | What If Plans |
| IV | `roles` | Participation & Roles |
| V | `agreement` | The Many Hands Agreement |
| VI | `shrimp` | Shrimp |

Steps and fields are fully configurable via the Application Builder (`/admin/configure`). Admin-added custom sections and fields are also supported. Custom field answers are submitted as `custom_answers` (JSONB) alongside the standard fields.

The form config is read fresh from `page_content` on every load — no caching. Step numerals (I, II, III…) are derived from position, not stored.

---

### Schedule (`/schedule`)

**Who:** Approved members  
**What:** Full public camp schedule — same `ScheduleSection` + `ScheduleCalendarClient` as the public homepage, wrapped in the member layout with the shared nav. Accessible via the Schedule nav link or "View full schedule →" / "View full calendar →" links on the dashboard.

---

### Volunteer (`/volunteer`)

**Who:** People who want to help but aren't applying as members  
**What:** Single-page signup form (`VolunteerForm`) driven by the volunteer form config stored in `page_content` (`config_volunteer_form`).

Collects name, contact info, pronouns, photo, signup intent, days available, and notes. All fields are configurable via the Application Builder. If `config.open === false`, shows a "Volunteer Signup Closed" screen instead.

**Admin preview:** `?admin_preview=1` bypasses redirect checks for admins.

---

## Authenticated Member Pages

### Profile (`/profile`)

**Who:** Signed-in users with an approved application  
**What:** The member's personal hub.

Sections:
- **Header row** — avatar (260px circle, gold border), centered via `1fr auto 1fr` grid, with role badge overlaid (`transform: translate(-40px, -28px)`). Gear icon (⚙) sits next to the display name and opens `ProfileSettings`.
- **Attunement Status** (`AttunementStatus.tsx`) — parchment card with checklist:
  - Application Approved (always done once on this page)
  - Photo Uploaded — checks `avatar_url`
  - Contribution Selected — checks `contributions.length > 0`; clicking opens ProfileSettings to contributions field
  - Role Selected — checks `campSignup.role_id` (non-pending)
  - Shift Assigned — checks `campSignup.schedule_event_id`
- **Signup Section** (`SignupSection.tsx`) — role/shift picker for approved members. Has "Suggest a role" button that opens `SuggestRoleModal`
- **Commitments** (`CommitmentsSection.tsx`) — shows selected role + shift. `showManageLink` prop controls the "Manage commitments →" footer link — only `true` on `/profile`, not on member-view pages.
- **Personal Schedule** (`PersonalScheduleCalendar.tsx`) — events relevant to the member based on their `setup_preference` and `contribution_type` matching. "View full calendar →" links to `/schedule`.
- **Settings** — gear icon (next to name) opens `ProfileSettings` modal (edit profile fields, contributions, avatar)

Max page width: `1100px`. Layout uses CSS classes (`profile-main-grid`, `profile-info-grid`, `profile-badge-row`) for responsive behavior.

**Custom event:** `ProfileSettings` listens for `glaum:open-settings` dispatched by `AttunementStatus` when member clicks an incomplete item.

---

- 6 collapsible step sections (Basic Information → Shrimp), plus any custom sections
- Per step: editable title and subtitle, visibility toggle (canHide steps only), ↑↓ reorder, ✕ delete
- Per field: visibility toggle (canHide fields only), inline label editor, inline description editor, REQUIRED/OPTIONAL badge (clickable where allowed), CORE badge for non-hideable built-in fields

### Role Badge

Generated at `/api/badge?role=...&dept=...` as a PNG. Displayed on profile and member pages. See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for generation details.

### Role Suggestion Flow

1. Member opens `SuggestRoleModal` from the Signup Section
2. Fills in department name + role name + optional notes
3. `POST /api/role-suggestions` → creates row in `role_suggestions` + admin notification
4. Admin sees it in "Role Suggestions" section
5. Approve → finds/creates dept (case-insensitive), creates role, notifies member via `user_notifications`
6. Reject → notifies member via `user_notifications`

### Contributions / Setup Preference

Members select setup preferences during application (`setup_preference TEXT[]`):
- `'Setup'` — pre-event setup crew
- `'Teardown'` — post-event teardown crew
- `'Decor'` — decoration crew (auto-added if member's role is in the Decor department)
- `'Other'` — other contributions

`schedule_events.contribution_type` links events to these preferences. Matching events appear on the member's Personal Schedule.

### Notifications

**Admin notifications** (`admin_notifications`): triggered by new applications, volunteer signups, role suggestions.  
**User notifications** (`user_notifications`): triggered by application status changes, role suggestion decisions, and new messages.

User notification `event_type` values and their bell link destinations:

- Mark all as read
- Delete all (admin only)
