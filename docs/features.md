# Feature Map

---

## Navigation

The site uses a single shared `Header` component (`components/HeaderClient.tsx`) on all pages. Nav links switch based on auth + approval state.

**Unauthenticated / not approved:**
```
Glåüm   About · Participate · Schedule · Apply     [Sign in]
```

**Approved members:**
```
Glåüm   Home · Schedule · Many Hands · Messages · My Profile   [🔔 avatar▾]
```

- `Messages` shows an unread count badge (polled every 30s via `/api/messages/unread`)
- Avatar dropdown: Admin link (admin only) + Sign out
- Mobile: hamburger menu with the same contextual links

Nav links for non-approved signed-in users (pending/rejected) show the public set — `/apply` is the only meaningful destination for them.

---

## Public Pages

### Homepage (`/`)

**Who:** Anyone (public view) / Approved members (dashboard view)  
**What:** Two distinct experiences depending on auth state.

**Public (not signed in):**
- TokyoDreams display heading + camp logo
- Hero tagline (`home_tagline` from `page_content`)
- Embedded public schedule (`ScheduleSection` + `ScheduleCalendarClient`)
  - Mobile: day-tab switcher (< 640px)
  - Desktop: 6-column grid
- About + Participate sections (editable via Admin → Edit Page)
- Footer with hands SVG decorations

**Member dashboard (approved + signed in):**

Fixed top sections (always present, not reorderable):
1. **Hero banner** — welcome greeting, countdown to event, hero tagline (`home_tagline`, editable inline)
2. **Attunement + Commitments** — side-by-side (`dash-grid`)
3. **Attunement banner** (renders only while actionable): outstanding required tasks / unfilled commitments → `/profile`

Configurable widgets (order, visibility, and width controlled by admin via the page editor):

| Widget ID | Default label | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `announcements` | Announcements | Visible, non-expired admin announcements; pinned first. Hidden if empty |
| `resources` | Bring Something | One row per resource list with gaps — the **list is the headline** ("Shared Kitchen"), "N items still needed — stove, cooler" the description; top 3 lists + "+N more lists". The **whole card** links to `/participate#bring` (`getUnmetResourceNeeds` in `lib/resources.ts`, offers excluded). Demand-driven: hidden once everything's covered |
| `shoutouts` | Shoutouts | Member-posted shoutouts (newest first). Approved members post via a "✦ Share a shoutout" button at the bottom that opens an inline composer; authors and admins can delete (✕). See **Shoutouts** under Supporting Features |
| `polls` | Polls | Active, non-expired admin polls. Members vote inline; results visible to everyone (voted or not) |
| `events` | Upcoming Gatherings | Pre-camp + at-camp `schedule_events` in the next 14 days. "View full schedule →" links to `/schedule` |
| `spotlight` | Meet a Member | Left: rotating member spotlight (cycles every minute). Right: Upcoming Gatherings list |
| `activity` | Recent Activity | Mixed feed of member joins + profile updates, up to 6 items |

Fixed bottom section (always present):
- **Role & Shift + Many Hands** — quick-link grid to `/participate` and `/members`

**Widget layout:** widgets wrap in a flex row; each is full-width by default or half-width when configured (two consecutive halves pair side by side). All revert to full width on mobile.

**Dashboard layout** is stored as `dashboard_layout` JSON in `page_content`:
```json
{ "order": ["announcements","shoutouts","polls","events","spotlight","activity"], "hidden": [], "widths": {} }
```

Admin-only: **"✎ Edit Page"** floating button (bottom-right). Clicking enters inline edit mode:
- A top bar appears: `Editing · [+ Poll] [Edit Text] [Save] [✕]`
- All widgets get a gold dashed outline
- Hovering a widget reveals a `⠿ Label [½]` handle in its top-right corner
- **Drag the handle** to reorder widgets — the card physically follows the cursor (`position: fixed`) while a dashed placeholder holds the drop slot
- **Click `½`** on the handle to toggle that widget between full and half width (updates live on the page before saving)
- **Click a gold-underlined text element** (e.g. the hero tagline) to edit it inline (`contenteditable`)
- **`+ Poll`** — opens a slide-in panel to create a new poll
- **`Edit Text`** — opens a slide-in panel for copy fields not visible on the dashboard (quote card, About, Participate)
- **`Save`** — writes new order + widths + any text edits to `page_content` and reloads

---

### Apply (`/apply`)

**Who:** Prospective camp members  
**What:** Multi-step application wizard (`ApplyWizard`) driven by the form config stored in `page_content` (`config_member_form`).

**States:**

| State | Condition | What's shown |
|---|---|---|
| Track picker | Signed in, no application | Choose Member or Volunteer track |
| Wizard | `?track=member` | 6-step (or more) multi-step form |
| Applications closed | `config.open === false` | Closed message |
| Pending / Rejected | `application.status` is `pending` or `rejected` | Redirect to `/profile` |
| Approved | `application.status === 'approved'` | Redirect to `/profile#role-signup` |

**Admin preview:** `?track=member&admin_preview=1` lets admins preview the form even when they already have an approved application. Bypasses redirect checks.

**Wizard steps (default):**

| Step | Key | Title |
|---|---|---|
| I | `basic` | Basic Information |
| II | `registry` | Many Hands Registry |
| III | `plans` | What If Plans |
| IV | `roles` | Participation & Roles |
| V | `agreement` | The Many Hands Agreement |
| VI | `shrimp` | Shrimp |

Steps and fields are fully configurable via the Application Builder (`/admin/configure`). Admin-added custom sections and fields are also supported. Custom field answers are submitted as `custom_answers` (JSONB) alongside the standard fields.

The form config is read fresh from `page_content` on every load — no caching. Step numerals (I, II, III…) are derived from position, not stored.

---

### Schedule (`/schedule`)

**Who:** Approved members  
**What:** Full public camp schedule — same `ScheduleSection` + `ScheduleCalendarClient` as the public homepage, wrapped in the member layout with the shared nav. On the calendar, recurring events with picked days (`recurrence_days`) render as blocks in those day columns; only true every-day recurring events sit in the "✦ Every Day ✦" card section below the grid. Accessible via the Schedule nav link or "View full schedule →" / "View full calendar →" links on the dashboard.

---

### Volunteer (`/volunteer`)

**Who:** People who want to help but aren't applying as members  
**What:** Single-page signup form (`VolunteerForm`) driven by the volunteer form config stored in `page_content` (`config_volunteer_form`).

Collects name, contact info, pronouns, photo, signup intent, days available, and notes. All fields are configurable via the Application Builder. If `config.open === false`, shows a "Volunteer Signup Closed" screen instead.

Volunteers are **admin-coordinated, not self-serve**: the signup intents (shift / role / other) and shift interests are signals surfaced in Admin → Volunteers, and organizers reach out directly. `/participate` and the signup APIs stay gated on an approved members row, so an active volunteer's profile checklist (`TaskStatus.tsx`, `track='volunteer'`) shows a pending "we'll reach out" state rather than role/shift pickers. Someone who should hold a role (e.g. a pre-event contributor) is admitted as a regular member instead — see the volunteers→members fold planned in [generalizability-log.md](generalizability-log.md).

**Admin preview:** `?admin_preview=1` bypasses redirect checks for admins.

---

## Authenticated Member Pages

### Profile (`/profile`)

**Who:** Signed-in users with an approved application  
**What:** The member's personal hub.

The page reads like a ceremonial registry, separating three concepts: **Designation** (identity), **Active Commitments** (what they're doing now), and **Distinctions** (earned honours). Engraved medals are reserved for honours — operational info is plain, legible UI.

Sections (approved members):
- **Header** — a three-column registry band (`profile-header-grid`, `1fr auto 1fr`, within the centered content width): **Designation** (left), **portrait** (center, the focal point), **Member Information** (right). No badges live here.
  - **Designation column** — the role + department as *text*, not a medal: a brass emblem (the department `icon`/`icon_image`, else `/handicon.png`), a "DESIGNATION" kicker, the role name (`TokyoDreams`), a `── ✦ ──` divider, the role purpose/description, then the department ("Department of X" is split onto two lines) closed by a small flourish. The **role title and department name are quiet links** (`.designation-link`, underline on hover) into the Registry of Roles (`/roles#<slug>`) — no separate "read more" line, and deliberately **no commitment pill here** (Chante: read harsh on the ceremonial column; the colour-scaled pill lives in the picker/registry where it informs choosing). Only shown when the member has an approved designation.
  - **Portrait** — `AvatarUpload` at an enlarged size (new `size` prop; 340px here vs the 260px default). Click to change photo.
  - **Member Information column** — "MEMBER" kicker, name + settings gear (`ProfileSettings`), the shared **`ApprovedCamperPill`** (`app/ApprovedCamperPill.tsx` — amethyst-glass status pill, same component the public profile uses), email, then (when the member has filled in the `quote` profile field) an italic **quote** line, then an at-a-glance **stat list** (small gold line-icons + right-aligned values, built inline in `page.tsx` via `StatRow`/`StatIcon`): Member since (`joined_year`), Active Commitments (group + held-shift + resource-claim count), Distinctions Earned (count), Attunement Status (Fully Attuned / N left).
- **About** — a centered card shown when the member has filled in the `bio` profile field, rendered via `RichText` (`lib/markdown-lite.tsx`). Sits at the top of the approved body. Read-only presentation; the value is edited in the Profile Details card below.
- **Active Commitments** (`CommitmentsSection.tsx`, left card) — the member's groups + **all held shifts** (many-to-many, real-date labels from `event_date`) + **shared-resource claims** (`BRINGING` rows, "Camping Stove ×2 · Shared Kitchen" — see [Shared Resources](#shared-resources)) as legible list rows: circle icon, title, one-line description, a pill (`GROUP`/`TEAM`/`SHIFT`/`LEAD`/`BRINGING`) and a chevron affordance. Rendered with the `hideRole` prop so the designation is **not** duplicated here (it lives in the header). Icon/description come from `getMemberGroups` → `groupCommitmentMeta` (`lib/groups.ts`): the row icon is the group's emoji `icon`, else its uploaded `icon_image` (rendered as a circle-filling `<img>`), else `✦`; the description falls back to the matching default contribution one-liner when the group has none. `showManageLink` (profile only) renders the centered "View all commitments ›" footer → `/participate`. (This card is `/profile`-only; the public `/members/[id]` renders its own collection-grouped **Contributions** medallions instead — see Member Profile below.)
- **Attunement Status** (`AttunementStatus.tsx`, right card) — parchment card with checklist. **Fully admin-managed** (Admin → Manage → Attunement Tasks, `AttunementTasksManager.tsx`); the list lives in `page_content.config_attunement_tasks` (JSON), parsed by `parseAttunementTasks` in `lib/site-config.ts`. Each task has a `requirement` that auto-completes it; the filtering + done/action logic lives in `buildAttunementChecklist` (`lib/attunement.ts`), the **single source of truth shared by `app/profile/page.tsx` and `app/page.tsx` (home dashboard banner)** so counts stay in sync. Honours each task's `enabled` flag and drops the `shift` task while shift signup is closed; hidden if no enabled tasks. The Commitments and Attunement cards are kept **equal height** (main grid `align-items: stretch`; each card fills the row and anchors its footer/verdict to the bottom). Requirement types (`ATTUNEMENT_REQUIREMENTS`):
  - `role` — `campSignup.role_id` set & non-pending; links to `/participate`
  - `shift` — with a `shiftTypeId` + `requiredHours`: the **universal hours requirement** — done when the member's held hours of that shift type (summed slot durations, `lib/shift-attunement.ts` `getMemberShiftState`, over `member_shift_signups` ∪ the legacy single signup) reach the target; the label shows live `X/Yh` progress. Without a `shiftTypeId` ("Any shift"): legacy boolean — holds ≥1 shift. Links to `/participate`. **Derived lines:** group/role shift requirements (`required_shift_type_id`/`required_shift_hours`) are *not* authored tasks — they're appended to the checklist automatically for members who belong (max hours on same-type overlap; role only when approved), and disappear on leaving. All shift lines hide while shift signup is closed.
  - `collection` — **membership in a group collection.** The task carries a `collectionId` (which collection; **unset = any collection**, i.e. total group count) and a `requiredCount` (how many memberships needed, default 1). Done when the member belongs to ≥ `requiredCount` groups in that collection; links to `/participate` (where members self-join). In the admin builder the requirement dropdown lists each collection under a "Collection membership" group, with a **count input capped at the number of groups in the chosen collection** (can't require more than exist). Replaces the old `contribution` requirement, which is auto-migrated on parse to an any-collection task (count 1) — identical behaviour.
  - `photo` — checks `avatar_url`; opens ProfileSettings photo
  - `approved` — always done on this page (reassuring first step)
  - Default list (when key absent) mirrors the original five hardcoded items (the "Contribution Selected" default is now an any-collection membership task).
  - **Nudge emails** — a daily Vercel Cron (`GET /api/cron/attunement-nudges`, 16:00 UTC; see `docs/architecture.md` → Cron) emails each approved member their outstanding checklist at an admin-set cadence (**Reminder emails** select at the top of the Attunement Tasks manager → `config_attunement_nudge_days`: Off / Daily / Every 2 days / Every 3 days / Weekly, default every 2 days), computed per member with the same `buildAttunementChecklist` + `getMemberShiftState`/`getMemberGroups` (`lib/attunement-nudge.ts` `collectOutstandingAttunement`), so the email always matches the site. Required tasks headline the email; outstanding **commitment** items (derived group/role hours) ride along in a gentler second section — reminded, never framed as blockers. Each item deep-links via its checklist `href`; the CTA lands on `/profile`. Fully attuned members get nothing. Members opt out via **Attunement reminders** in `/profile#notifications` (`notification_preferences.email_attunement_nudges`, default ON); sends are recorded in the `attunement_nudges` ledger (cadence-derived cooldown = idempotent under double fires). Template: `sendAttunementNudgeEmail` (`lib/send-email.ts`); the countdown line uses the configured event start date (`lib/camp-event.ts` `daysUntilEvent`, shared with the home banner). Migration `056`.
- **Cabinet of Distinctions** (`CabinetOfDistinctions.tsx`, full-width band below the two cards) — a centered gallery of earned **engraved medals** (honours, *not* controls — nothing is clickable). Each medal renders the distinction's `image` (from the shared asset library — a built-in or an upload) inside a CSS medal frame (gold ring + purple glow), with an uppercase label, an optional short static **engraving** caption (gold italic, ≤32 chars), and an optional dynamic year. Art is sized by height + clipped to the circle so the emblem fills the frame; built-in art should be a transparent emblem with no baked rim (the frame supplies the ring). A `glyph` emoji is the fallback when a rule has no `image`. Shown only when ≥1 is earned. Distinctions are **derived, never stored** — see [Distinctions](#distinctions) below.
- **Signup Section** (`SignupSection.tsx`) — role picker + the **multi-shift calendar picker** (see Shifts below); "Suggest a role" opens `SuggestRoleModal`. Rendered on `/participate` (Participate); `/profile` no longer embeds it (the header designation + Commitments card carry the member's current state, with links into `/participate` and `/roles`).
- **Personal Schedule** (`PersonalSchedule.tsx` → `PersonalScheduleCalendar.tsx`) — **mandatory events** (`participation_type='mandatory'`, everyone) + the **shifts the member holds** (`member_shift_signups` ∪ legacy single signup, deduped). Day columns derive from the events' real dates (`lib/schedule-days.ts`); cards are coloured by shift-type hue (`lib/shift-colors.ts`). "View full calendar →" → `/schedule`.
- **Profile Details** (`ProfileDetails.tsx`, client) — an editable card for the member's registry-defined detail fields (bio, quote, and any admin-added custom fields), reading/writing `member_profiles.values` via `/api/profile/fields`. Only shows fields that are **Visible** (`public`) or member-editable; admin-only fields (not Visible) never appear here — they surface on `/admin/[id]`. Renders nothing until the registry has such fields. The fields are defined in the Profile Field registry (Admin → Configure → **Profile Fields**, `ProfileFieldsManager`); see [profile-architecture.md](profile-architecture.md).
- **Settings** — gear icon opens `ProfileSettings` (edit profile fields, avatar). Groups are admin-assigned, so not edited here.

Max content width: `1100px`. Layout uses CSS classes (`profile-main-grid` [`1.1fr 1fr`, equal-height], `profile-info-grid`, `profile-header-grid`) for responsive behavior; under 768px the header stacks portrait → identity → designation.

**Custom event:** `ProfileSettings` listens for `glaum:open-settings` dispatched by `AttunementStatus` when member clicks an incomplete item.

---

### Registry of Roles (`/roles`)

**Who:** Approved members only (redirects others to `/profile`; signed-out → `/sign-in`)
**What:** The permanent, readable home for every department and role — the documentation the signup picker links into. One scrollable page, no accordions.

- **Department sections** — emblem in a brass ring, department name (`TokyoDreams`), italic description, `── ✦ ──` divider; a **department chip rail** at the top jumps to each section. Departments with no roles are omitted.
- **Role entries** — each an anchored card (`/roles#<slug>`, slugs derived from names by `roleSlug` in `lib/role-slug.ts` — never stored): role name, **commitment pill**, live **capacity pill** (`N of M open` / `Full`), "Approval required" pill where relevant; then the full charge — purpose, **Before/During the event** ✦-lists (two columns ≥640px), *Ideal for*. The member's own role is highlighted gold.
- **Claim in place** (`ClaimRoleButton.tsx`, client) — each entry ends with **Claim this role** (or **Request this role** when `requires_approval`), a two-step inline confirm that POSTs the same `/api/signup` the picker uses, then `router.refresh()`. Current role shows "✦ Your role" (or "Requested — pending approval"); full roles show "Full".
- Server component; reads `departments`/`roles`/`camp_signups` via `supabaseAdmin` directly (no new API route). Deep-linked from the signup picker's role modal, the "Your Role" card, and the profile designation ("Read your full charge ✦").

**Key files:** `app/roles/page.tsx`, `app/roles/ClaimRoleButton.tsx`, `lib/role-slug.ts`

---

### Member Directory (`/members`)

**Who:** Approved members only (redirects others to `/profile`)  
**What:** Grid of approved member cards.

Each card shows: circular avatar (gold border), display name, and role name if assigned and approved (gold small-caps). Members without an avatar show a `✦` glyph rather than an initial.

**Equal-height cards (load-bearing):** the role text is always rendered (just hidden when absent) and the grid/flex setup forces uniform card heights across rows. Don't "clean up" the empty role line — it's intentional, removing it makes rows ragged.

Linked from nav as "Many Hands".

---

### Member Profile (`/members/[id]`)

**Who:** Approved members  
**What:** View another member's public profile — a ceremonial registry page with its **own** layout (not the same components as your own `/profile`).

- Lookup by `clerk_user_id` (default) or UUID.
- **Hero:** circular portrait beside the identity block — name, pronouns, "Member since", quote, the shared **`ApprovedCamperPill`** (`app/ApprovedCamperPill.tsx`, amethyst-glass status pill), and a **"✉ Message"** button (→ `/messages/[clerk_user_id]`, with a hover lift via `.pub-msg-btn`).
- **About:** the member's `bio` rendered as plain **left-aligned narrative text (no card)**, inset under the hero.
- **Roles & Responsibilities** (card): department + primary role, plus supporting roles, as medallion rows (`DetailRow` / `IconMedallion`).
- **Contributions** (card): the member's group memberships, **grouped under each collection's name** (only collections with `show_on_profile`), laid out **inline with a soft vertical divider** between collections and wrapping to its own row when they don't fit (`groupByCollection` + `ColHeading` + `IconMedallion`). Each group's medallion is its emoji `icon` / uploaded `icon_image` / `✦`.
- **Distinctions:** `CabinetOfDistinctions` (compact) — earned medals, derived.
- **Profile** + **Skills & Gifts:** public registry fields (see [profile-architecture.md](profile-architecture.md)).
- Read-only; no editing controls.

---

### Messages (`/messages`)

**Who:** Approved members  
**What:** Inbox listing **direct conversations and group threads** together, most recent first.

- Each row shows an avatar (or the **group's icon** for group threads), display name, last message preview, timestamp, and unread count badge. Group rows link to `/messages/g/[groupId]`; DM rows to `/messages/[userId]`.
- **Filter tabs — All / Direct / Groups** (shown only when you have both kinds), each with its own unread badge so groups don't get buried under DMs.
- **Group threads always appear** for groups you belong to — even with no messages yet (an entry point: "No messages yet — start the conversation"). Direct conversations appear only once they have messages.
- **"✉ New Message" button** (top-right) opens a searchable member picker modal for **DMs**. **"✦ Find a group"** (beside it) opens a picker of **open, listed** groups you can self-join (`/api/groups/joinable` → `/join`); admin-assigned groups still appear automatically once you're a member.
- **Muted** group threads show a 🔕 and never badge.
- Conversations come from `/api/messages`, backed by the conversations model (`lib/conversations.ts`); group membership is derived from `group_members`, profiles/group names enriched server-side.
- **Deleted members:** DM conversations with a member whose application was removed still appear; their name falls back to the `messages.sender_name` snapshot, or "Member" if none.

---

### Message Thread (`/messages/[userId]`)

**Who:** Approved members  
**What:** Full conversation thread with another approved member.

- Sticky header: back arrow (→ `/messages`), avatar + name (links to `/members/[id]`)
- Message bubbles: sent messages right-aligned (purple tint), received left-aligned (gold tint)
- Timestamps shown when gap between messages > 5 minutes
- Compose area: auto-expanding textarea, 2,000 char limit with counter (shown at 80% full), Enter to send / Shift+Enter for new line
- Polls for new messages every 12 seconds
- Auto-scrolls to bottom on new messages
- Messages from the other person are marked read on page load (via `GET /api/messages/[userId]`)
- **Deleted/inactive other member:** if their application is gone, the page no longer 404s — it renders the thread **read-only** (only when message history exists; otherwise still 404). The header shows their snapshot name (`messages.sender_name`, or "Former member") with a "No longer active" note and is **not** linked to `/members/[id]`; the composer is replaced with a "can't reply" notice (matching `POST /api/messages`, which rejects non-approved recipients). Sender names are snapshotted onto each message at send time so history survives deletion (migration `032`).

---

### Group Thread (`/messages/g/[groupId]`)

**Who:** Members of that group (non-members are redirected to `/messages`; the API returns 403)  
**What:** A shared thread for a group to coordinate. Every group has one (group messaging — full design in [group-messaging.md](group-messaging.md)).

- Sticky header: back arrow, the group's icon + name. Flat, chronological message list with sender name + avatar; consecutive messages from the same sender are grouped.
- **Replies (one level, Slack-style):** each top-level message shows **💬 N replies** (or **↳ Reply**) that expands a collapsible reply thread inline with its own composer. Replies never nest further — enforced both in the UI and in `POST /api/messages/g/[groupId]` (a reply's parent must be a top-level message in the same conversation).
- **`@mention`:** typing `@` in the composer opens a member autocomplete (arrow/Enter/Tab/Esc, caret-aware). On send, the server matches `@Name` against current member display names (so mentions typed in replies notify too), creating an in-app notification **and** an email to the mentioned member. In the rendered message, a recognized mention is shown as a colored pill **linked to that member's profile** (`/members/[id]`) — purple for others, gold when it's **you** — so a successful mention is visually confirmed (an `@name` that doesn't match a member stays plain text).
- **Quiet by default:** ordinary posts create **no emails or notification-feed rows** — the unread badge is the only signal. `@mentions` are the deliberate exception (email gated by the recipient's `email_new_message` pref, throttled 30 min per group).
- Polls every 12s; marks read on view (advances `last_read_at`); auto-scrolls only on new *top-level* messages so reading a thread isn't interrupted.
- **Bell menu** (bell icon at the top-right of the thread header; renders as a slashed/dimmed bell when muted): **Mute** (muted threads don't badge), **Email me about this group** (opt into a throttled activity email for every post), and — for **open** groups — **Leave group**. Backed by `PATCH /api/messages/g/[groupId]/me` and `POST /api/groups/[id]/leave`.

## Admin Pages

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)

**Who:** Users with `publicMetadata.role === 'admin'` in Clerk  
**What:** Manage all aspects of the camp.

Sections (collapsible via `CollapsibleSection`):

| Section | Component | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Registered Hands | `VolunteersSection` | Review members + outside volunteers |
| Role Requests | `RoleRequestsSection` | Approve/reject member role claims |
| Role Suggestions | `RoleSuggestionsSection` | Review member-submitted dept/role suggestions |
| Departments | `DepartmentsManager` | CRUD for departments + roles |
| Announcements | `AnnouncementsManager` | Create/edit/delete member-facing announcements |
| Polls | `PollsManager` | Create/edit/delete/toggle polls. Each poll has: question, 2–10 options, visible toggle, multiple-choice toggle, optional expiry |
| Schedule | `ScheduleManager` | CRUD for schedule events, laid out as a day-grouped program view: one section per day (same day model as the member calendar — `buildScheduleDays`, configured range ∪ event dates, so admin and member views always agree), rows time-sorted with an aligned time column, a day-jump chip rail on top, per-day "+ Add" buttons that prefill the date, an **Undated** bucket for legacy rows missing a date, and the Recurring group below (each row sub-labelled "Every day" or its picked dates). **Every event carries structured Start/End times** (`TimeField`, `app/components/TimeField.tsx` — a house-styled replacement for the native `<input type="time">` used here and in the Lead-Up modal: free-text input accepting "7pm"/"7:30 pm"/"19:00"/"730" over a 15-minute options dropdown, End flavour listing times after the Start with the resulting duration; value contract stays "HH:MM"|null. Start required on all events, end also required on shifts — there is no free-text time field; the display `time` string derives on save, and editing a legacy row prefills Start/End parsed from its old text). **Recurring events pick their days**: the modal's Recurring toggle reveals "Repeats on" day chips (the schedule's day columns); all chips lit = `recurrence_days` NULL = every day incl. later range growth, a subset = an array of ISO dates (migration `057`). A **List ⇄ Week toggle** swaps the day sections for a **week grid** (`ScheduleWeekView`): day columns × hour axis in the member calendar's visual language (same hour scale + shift-type hues from `lib/shift-colors.ts`, mandatory teal), overlapping events share the column side-by-side, recurring events render as ghosted bands in each column they repeat on (`recurrence_days` NULL = every column), shift blocks show `n/cap` + a "✦ no lead" flag; click a block to edit, click an empty slot to add with that day + nearest half-hour prefilled, and **drag a block to reschedule it** (pointer-based, 15-minute snap: vertical moves the time keeping the duration, crossing columns moves the day; drop PATCHes structured start/end + `event_date` + the derived display `time`, optimistic with snap-back on failure; recurring ghosts and the fix-me strip stay click-to-edit); dated-but-untimed rows surface in a fix-me strip. Drag-reorder exists only on recurring rows (the one place `sort_order` affects member display; dated events order by date + time everywhere). Shift rows carry a **compact roster** (`ShiftRoster`, fed by `GET /api/admin/schedule/rosters`): count vs capacity, a "✦ no lead yet" hint on lead-enabled shifts with signups but no lead, and one chip per holder (✦ = lead) — clicking a chip promotes/demotes via the same `set_shift_role` PATCH as the member page; legacy-only holds (no `member_shift_signups` row) are inert |
| Lead-Up Gatherings | `LeadUpGatheringsManager` | CRUD for lead-up gatherings (spec: [`lead-up-gatherings.md`](./lead-up-gatherings.md)) topped by a **month calendar** (`LeadUpCalendar`) — the runway at a glance: click an empty day to add a gathering there (date prefilled), click a gathering chip to edit it; ‹ › month nav opens on the next upcoming gathering's month; the configured event range (Configure → Event Dates) is tinted purple with an "Event" marker; past days dimmed; hidden gatherings at low opacity with ○. The editor requires title + date + start time (`<input type="time">`, end optional). The row list below keeps Notify / visibility / delete per gathering |
| Configure Applications | link → `/admin/configure` | Opens the Application Builder |
| Debug Tools | `DebugSection` | Reset test user data |
| Applications | `ApplicationRow` list | Review + approve/reject applications |

**Notifications** (`NotificationBell` + `NotificationsSection`): bell icon in admin header shows unread count. Supports mark-as-read per item, mark-all-read, and delete all.

---

### Application Builder (`/admin/configure`)

**Who:** Admin  
**What:** Full-page form builder for configuring both the Camp Member application and Volunteer signup.

Reached via the "Configure Applications →" link on the admin dashboard.

**The member application is fully modular** — every section and field (built-in or admin-added) can be reordered, edited, resized, hidden, and (non-core) deleted. Config is the source of truth: deletions stick; "Reset to defaults" restores.

**Tab: Camp Member Application**
- Open/closed toggle — hides the form from new applicants when closed
- Collapsible step sections (built-in: Basic Information, Many Hands Registry, What If Plans, Participation & Roles, The Many Hands Agreement, Shrimp) plus any custom sections. Per section: editable title/subtitle, hide, ↑↓ reorder (a custom section can sit **anywhere**, including first), ✕ delete (Basic Information can't be deleted).
- Per field: hide (eye), inline label + description editors, **REQUIRED/OPTIONAL** toggle, **½ / ▭ width** toggle (consecutive halves pair into a two-column row), **↑↓ reorder** (non-locked fields can move past locked ones), ✕ delete. A small read-only type tag shows each custom field's type.
- **Field types:** Short text, Long text, Single choice, Multiple choice (choice fields auto-reveal a fill-in when an option named "Other" is selected), **File upload**, **Agreement** (a checklist of clauses — all required when the field is required), **Group selection** (`group_select`, member form only — a checklist of Groups the applicant can opt into; the admin picks *which* groups the field offers via a checklist in the builder, stored in the field's `options` (unset = all groups); selections add the applicant to those groups on submit). Plus **Divider** and **Text block** layout elements (text blocks render markdown-lite: blank-line paragraphs, `*`/`✦` bullets, `[text](url)`/bare links, `**bold**`).
- **Locked core fields:** First/Last Name, Email, Phone (always present + required, read-only in the builder); Photo is also locked but its Required is toggleable (so admins can allow blank profiles). These are the only NOT-NULL-backed fields.
- "+ Short text / Long text / Single choice / Multiple choice / File upload / Agreement / Group selection / Divider / Text block" buttons at the bottom of every expanded step; "+ Add section" below the step list.
- **Apply-page card editor** — each tab has a title + description editor for the `/apply` TrackPicker card (Camp Member card on the Member tab, Volunteer card on the Volunteer tab), stored in `page_content.config_track_picker`.

**Tab: Volunteer Signup** — open/closed toggle + flat field list with the same per-field controls.

**Saving:** Everything **auto-saves**. Toggles/reorder/width/add/delete save immediately; typed text (labels, descriptions, options/clauses, titles) debounce-saves ~0.7s after you stop typing. A floating top-right status pill shows **Saving… / All changes saved / error + Retry**.

**Config storage:** JSON in `page_content` under `config_member_form` and `config_volunteer_form`. `mergeMemberConfig` (in `lib/form-config.ts`) reconciles saved config with defaults: it **preserves the saved order of all sections** (built-in + custom), merges built-in field overrides, keeps custom fields as-is, and only re-injects missing *locked* fields (deleted non-core fields stay deleted). Agreement clauses and most option lists now live in the field's `options` in the config (not the legacy `member_acknowledgements` key, which is still read as a fallback).

**Test link:** "Test this application →" opens `/apply?track=member&admin_preview=1` to preview the form live as an admin.

**Key file:** `lib/form-config.ts` — defines `MemberFormConfig`, `VolunteerFormConfig`, all default step/field definitions, and `mergeMemberConfig`/`mergeVolunteerConfig` helpers.

**Mobile layout:** The sidebar collapses to a horizontal scrollable step-indicator strip at the top. Two-column form grids (name pairs, date pairs, etc.) collapse to single column at `< 768px`. `isMobile` is detected via `window.innerWidth < 768` and passed as a prop to each section component.

### Profile Fields (`/admin/configure` → Profile Fields)

**Who:** Admin
**What:** The registry of **member profile detail fields** — the configurable data each member carries (bio, quote, and any admin-added fields like skills or languages). One place defines what a piece of member data means; applications collect it and distinctions evaluate it. Managed inline via `ProfileFieldsManager` (a `Profile Fields` collapsible section on the Configure page), autosaving to `page_content.config_profile_fields` (JSON). Full model in [profile-architecture.md](profile-architecture.md).

- **Per field:** enable/disable, label, `key` (internal identity), description, type (Text / Long text / Number / Yes-No / Single-select / Multi-select / Date, with options for the selects), reorder, delete. Plus capability toggles:
  - **Visible** (the `public` flag) — **on** = shown on the member’s profile (and the editable Profile Details card); **off** = the field is **admin-only**, appearing solely in the member’s application detail (`/admin/[id]` → Profile Details). Never public.
  - **Editable** — members can edit their own value (on `/profile`).
  - **In apps** — the field can be attached to an application question (see below).
  - **In rules** — the field can be referenced by distinction rules.
  - **Catch-up** / **Required** — prompt existing members who haven’t filled the field in yet (Phase 4.5).
- **Ties into the Application Builder:** a custom application question can be bound to a profile field (`FieldConfig.profileFieldKey`), so its answer saves to `member_profiles.values` and is reused everywhere. The builder’s field-binding dropdown lists every **In apps** profile field (`applicationFields`).
- **Key stability (data safety):** a field’s `key` is the identity its saved answers are stored under. Renaming a field’s **label never changes its key** for any field that already existed when the manager loaded — only brand-new (this-session) fields auto-derive their key from the label. Editing the `key` box directly still re-keys it, which **disconnects existing member answers** (the old values remain in `member_profiles.values` under the old key — recoverable by setting the key back).
- **System fields** (groups, tenure, designation, …) are shown read-only at the bottom — derived at eval time, never stored, usable in distinction rules.

**Key files:** `app/admin/ProfileFieldsManager.tsx`, `lib/profile-fields.ts`

### Admin Application View (`/admin/[id]`)

**Who:** Admin  
**What:** Full detail view of a single application with approve/reject controls and role/shift management.

Sections:
- **Header** — avatar, name, status pill, submitted date
- **Approve / Reject controls** (`AdminActions`) — visible for pending applications
- **Remove member** (`RemoveMemberButton`) — visible for approved applications. Soft-removes: sets `status = 'cancelled'` with a reason, deletes the member's `camp_signups` (frees their role + shift), and notifies them (in-app + email). Reversible by re-approving.
- **Role & Shift** (`MemberSignupCard`) — shown when the member has a `clerk_user_id`:
  - Displays current role (department, role name, commitment level, approval status) and **every shift the member holds** (title, time, day — `member_shift_signups` ∪ legacy single, deduped)
  - **"Approve role"** button — appears when `role_approval_status === 'pending'`; calls `PATCH /api/admin/role-requests/[clerkUserId]`
  - **"Remove role"** button — clears `role_id` + `role_approval_status` from `camp_signups` via `PATCH /api/admin/signups/[clerkUserId]` with `{ clear_role: true }`
  - Per-shift **"Remove"** button — `{ remove_shift: <eventId> }` deletes that `member_shift_signups` row (and clears the legacy column if it pointed there); `{ clear_shift: true }` clears all
  - Confirmation dialog shown before any removal; UI updates optimistically after success
- **Full application fields** — all submitted built-in answers grouped by section
- **Additional Responses** — answers to admin-added custom fields, with labels resolved from the form config (orphaned/deleted-field answers shown by key). File-upload answers render as download links; "Other" fill-ins shown as an "Other: …" line. Answers to the built-in Many Hands Agreement still show in their own Acknowledgements section.
- **Profile Details** — the member's canonical profile-field values (`member_profiles.values`), rendered from the Profile Field registry. **This is the admin-only surface for fields marked _not_ Visible** (`public: false`) — those never appear on the member-facing profile and are tagged "· admin-only" here. Only shown when the member has values.

**Key files:** `app/admin/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/admin/MemberSignupCard.tsx`, `app/admin/RemoveMemberButton.tsx`  
**API:** `PATCH /api/admin/signups/[userId]` — accepts `{ clear_role: true }`, `{ remove_shift: <eventId> }` (one shift), or `{ clear_shift: true }` (all shifts; both the many-to-many table and the legacy column)

---

### Admin Overview (`/admin/overview`)

**Who:** Admin  
**What:** Summary stats + `MembersDropdown` for quick navigation.

Sections:
- **Needs attention** (first card) — up to five prioritized actionable lines (pending applications / volunteers / role requests / role suggestions / un-notified upcoming gathering / full-but-leadless shifts), each a verb deep-link into the console; empty state names the days to camp. Data: `lib/admin-attention.ts` (`getAttentionItems`). Counts that imply work elsewhere on the page are verb links too ("Review N pending →", "Assign in Groups →").
- **Participation** — approved member count, signup completion, active volunteer count, members list (expandable)
- **Shift Hours** — total committed, confirmed, pending, volunteer hours
- **Groups** — one card per row in the `groups` table (sort order honoured) with member pills, via `getGroupNamesByUser`; "In no group" card for unassigned members
- **Rideshare** — breakdown by rideshare intent
- **Poll Results** — all polls with bar chart per option (vote count + percentage). Leading option highlighted in gold. Shows Hidden/Closed badges. Hidden if no polls exist.

All admin surfaces also carry the **runway strip** inside the sticky `AdminNav`: "✦ N days to camp" plus the next dated milestones (upcoming gatherings, camp start) as jump links — `lib/admin-attention.ts` (`getAdminRunway`). The member detail page (`/admin/[id]`) shows **cross-reference chips** under the header: department·role, each group, and "N shifts held" (anchors to Role & Shift).

## Supporting Features

### Shoutouts

Member-posted shoutouts shown on the home-page member dashboard (the `shoutouts` widget). A lightweight, member-driven complement to admin Announcements.

**Member experience:**
- The widget shows the shoutout feed (newest first): author avatar, name, time-ago, and body.
- Approved members post via a **"✦ Share a shoutout"** button pinned at the bottom; it opens an inline composer (avatar + textarea, 250-char limit with counter, Cancel / Post). On success the composer collapses and the new shoutout appears at the top.
- A member can **delete their own** shoutout via the ✕ on it; **admins can delete any**.
- Author avatars are joined in JS from `applications` at render time (no FK), so they stay current.

**Data + auth:**
- Table `shoutouts` (migration `031`): `clerk_user_id`, `author_name` (display-name snapshot), `body` (1–250 chars, DB CHECK), `visible` (reserved for moderation), `created_at`.
- Posting requires an **approved** member (same check as role suggestions). Delete is allowed for the **author or an admin**.

**API routes:**
- `GET /api/shoutouts` — list visible shoutouts (authenticated)
- `POST /api/shoutouts` — post a shoutout (approved members)
- `DELETE /api/shoutouts/[id]` — delete a shoutout (author or admin)

**Key files:** `app/ShoutoutWidget.tsx`, `app/api/shoutouts/route.ts`, `app/api/shoutouts/[id]/route.ts`, wired into `app/page.tsx` (widget map) and `app/HomePageEditor.tsx` (layout label).

---

### Polls

Admin creates polls in the Admin Dashboard → Polls section (or via `+ Poll` in the page editor).

**Member experience:**
- Active (visible + non-expired) polls appear in the `polls` dashboard widget
- Results (progress bars, percentages, vote counts) are visible to **all** members, voted or not — voting just adds the ✓ highlight on your choice
- Members can change their vote at any time (previous votes are replaced)
- Single-choice and multiple-choice modes supported

**Admin experience:**
- Create/edit via `PollsManager` (Admin Dashboard) or the `+ Poll` button in page edit mode
- Visibility toggle per poll (hidden polls still store votes, just aren't shown to members)
- Optional expiry date — expired polls show a "closed" badge and accept no new votes
- Results visible in Admin Overview → Poll Results section with bar charts

**API routes:**
- `GET /api/admin/polls` — list all polls (admin only)
- `POST /api/admin/polls` — create poll (admin only)
- `PATCH /api/admin/polls/[id]` — edit poll (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/admin/polls/[id]` — delete poll + all votes (admin only)
- `POST /api/polls/[id]/vote` — submit or update a member's vote (authenticated members)

**Key files:** `app/PollWidget.tsx`, `app/admin/PollsManager.tsx`, `app/api/admin/polls/`, `app/api/polls/`

### Role Badge

Generated at `/api/badge?role=...&dept=...` as a PNG. Displayed on profile and member pages. See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for generation details.

### Shifts (multi-signup, hours requirements)

Rebuilt 2026-07-01 — full design + history in [shifts-redesign.md](shifts-redesign.md).

- **Model:** every schedule event has a `participation_type` (`general` / `shift` / `mandatory`). Shift events belong to a configurable **shift type** (`shift_types` registry — Setup, Teardown, Decor, Service, …; requirement-free kinds) and carry real `start_time`/`end_time` (duration = hours). Requirements are authored on whoever owes them: a **group/role** (`required_shift_type_id` + `required_shift_hours`, set in the group/role edit modals) or an **attunement task** (universal, e.g. "everyone owes 3h Service"). A shift type nothing requires is simply optional (e.g. a Tea shift).
- **Member picker** (`/participate`, `SignupSection.tsx` `ShiftsPicker`): a calendar of day columns derived from the shifts' real dates; cards coloured by shift type; owed-hours chips (`Teardown 0/3h`) above; one tap opens a styled confirm modal (`ShiftConfirmModal`) to sign up / cancel. Members hold **any number** of shifts (`member_shift_signups`); capacity + `config_shift_signup_open` enforced server-side. Held shifts are listed (cancellable) in the "Your Shifts" card and appear on the personal schedule + Commitments card.
- **API:** `GET/POST/DELETE /api/shift-signups` — slots with counts (many-to-many ∪ legacy single, deduped), the member's owed requirements (derived group/role merged with universal tasks, max hours per type), sign-up (admin notified), cancel (also clears the legacy `camp_signups.schedule_event_id` so hours never double-count).
- **Leads (shifts only — migrations `048`+`049`, gathering half scrapped by `050`):** whether a shift **has** a lead role is the organizer's call — a "This shift has a lead ✦" checkbox in the schedule editor (`schedule_events.needs_lead`, default off; some shifts don't need one). On lead-enabled shifts the offer comes **at signup time**: the confirm dialog shows an "I'd like to be the shift lead ✦" checkbox (only while the lead seat is empty); picker cards show "✦ needs a lead" until someone takes it, then "✦ Led by …". Held shifts keep a secondary offer/step-back link (gated on `needs_lead`; same `POST /api/shift-signups` with `role: 'member' | 'lead'`, server-rejected on non-lead events). The role lives on the `member_shift_signups` row — it disappears with the signup, co-leads are just multiple lead rows, and it's **display-only** (no permissions attach). Admins promote/demote from the member's shifts card on `/admin/[id]` **or from the shift's roster in the schedule editor** (both via `set_shift_role` on `PATCH /api/admin/signups/[userId]`). A shift that fills up with nobody holding the lead can no longer resolve itself at signup time, so the Overview **Needs attention** digest flags it ("… is fully signed up but has no lead ✦" → Program) — the organizer picks someone from the shift's roster and promotes them right there; there is deliberately **no automated nag** to holders. **Lead-up gatherings have no lead role** (built 2026-07-02, scrapped same day — migration `050`); gatherings keep the free-text `host` and binary RSVP. General `event_rsvps` also excluded.
- **Attunement:** reflects it all — see the `shift` requirement + derived lines under Attunement Status.
- **Admin:** shift types in Configure → Structure → **Shift Types**; slots created in the schedule editor (participation → shift type → start/end + capacity); **per-shift roster in the schedule editor** (who's signed up, count vs capacity, promote/demote leads — `GET /api/admin/schedule/rosters`); per-member shifts on `/admin/[id]`; "has shift" indicator on the roster (boolean, not hours-satisfaction — future polish).
- **Colours:** `lib/shift-colors.ts` — mandatory = teal; each shift type gets a palette hue by registry position (shared by both calendars + the picker; per-type configurable colour is a future hook).
- **Pending cleanup:** legacy columns (`event_type`, `contribution_type`, `event_category`, `camp_signups.schedule_event_id`/`shift_id`), the dormant `event_types` table, dead `/api/admin/shifts` routes, and the `lib/event-type-compat.ts` shim await a final drop migration once the redesign is verified live.

### Role Selection & Approval Flow

Members pick a role via `SignupSection` on `/participate` (Participate) — a **flat registry picker**: every role visible at once under **`TokyoDreams` department headers** (icon + name + `─ ✦` hairline, description beneath, generous gap between groups), as compact cards in a responsive grid (name, status, 2-line description clamp, colour-scaled commitment pill, 🔒 when approval-gated). Above the picker, the **Your Role / Your Shifts standing cards** are drawn as engraved **plaques** — a double rule (border + inset `outline`) with a centered `✦ Your Role ✦` kicker between hairlines, brass-ringed department emblem, `TokyoDreams` role name, on a **solid panel** (`#231132` + drop shadow) so mass, not brightness, separates them from the translucent single-hairline cards below. Frame strength is **constant regardless of filled/empty state** — no glow, no conditional emphasis (Chante, twice: the member's role is already highlighted in the full list; don't re-highlight it here). Tapping a card opens the **role detail modal** (`RoleDetailModal`) with the full charge (purpose, before/during, ideal-for), a "View in the Registry →" deep link, and the confirm button (`Confirm` / `Switch to this role` / `Request Role`). Roles can also be claimed directly on `/roles` (see Registry of Roles). Either path submits to `POST /api/signup`.

**Approval logic in `POST /api/signup`:**
- If the role changed (`isRoleChange = true`) and `roles.requires_approval = true` → `role_approval_status` is set to `'pending'` and an admin notification is created
- If the role changed and `requires_approval = false` → `role_approval_status` is set to `null` (immediately confirmed)
- If the role did **not** change → the existing `role_approval_status` is **preserved unchanged**. (Shift signups no longer flow through this endpoint — they use `/api/shift-signups` — so the historic wipe-on-shift-update hazard is gone; the guard remains for safety.)

**`role_approval_status` values:**
| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `null` | No approval needed (role doesn't require it), or role was cleared |
| `'pending'` | Waiting for admin review |
| `'approved'` | Admin approved the role request |

**Admin approval:** via `PATCH /api/admin/role-requests/[clerkUserId]` with `{ decision: 'approved' | 'rejected' }`. Approval sets `role_approval_status = 'approved'`. Rejection sets `role_id = null` and clears the status. Both send a `user_notifications` row to the member.

The dedicated **Participate** page (`/participate`) hosts `SignupSection` (role + shift), then the **Bring Something** shared-resources claims (`ResourceCommitments` — see [Shared Resources](#shared-resources); anchored `#bring` for the home-banner deep link, placed above groups because needs are live and time-sensitive while group membership is a set-once choice), then the **Your Groups** group opt-in (`GroupCommitments` — see [Groups](#groups)). The Commitments card's "Manage commitments →" link points here.

**Key file:** `app/api/signup/route.ts`

### Role Suggestion Flow

1. Member opens `SuggestRoleModal` from the Signup Section
2. Fills in department name + role name + optional notes
3. `POST /api/role-suggestions` → creates row in `role_suggestions` + admin notification
4. Admin sees it in "Role Suggestions" section
5. Approve → finds/creates dept (case-insensitive), creates role, notifies member via `user_notifications`
6. Reject → notifies member via `user_notifications`

### Groups

Configurable groups members belong to (e.g. Setup, Teardown, Decor). **Replaced** the old contribution-types/`setup_preference` mechanism (migration `030`; see [database.md](database.md) for the `groups` + `group_members` tables).

Every group also has a **message thread** for coordination — see [Group Thread](#group-thread-messagesggroupid) above and [group-messaging.md](group-messaging.md). Governance (`join_policy`, `visibility`) and member self-join/leave shipped in Phase 6; **leads** (`group_members.role`) and the `request` join policy are still to come.

**Admin — `Admin → Groups` (`GroupsManager.tsx`):**
- Create / edit / delete / reorder groups (name, description, icon). Deleting a group or collection asks via the styled in-app `ConfirmDialog` (names the item; see design-system.md → Confirm Dialog) instead of the native browser confirm; a non-empty collection gets a notice ("… isn't empty yet", with the group count) up front rather than a server error.
- **Who can join** — `admin_assigned` (admins manage membership; the default, for crews) or `open` (members self-join/leave). **Visibility** — `listed` (open groups appear in the member Find-a-group picker) or `hidden`. Open groups show an `OPEN` pill in the list.
- Expand a group to see its **roster** and **assign members** (searchable picker of approved members) or remove them. Each membership records a `source` (`admin`, `application`, or `self` for self-join).
- **Icon** (optional): the group modal uses the shared **`AssetImagePicker`** (see [Asset library & image picker](#asset-library--image-picker)) — pick a built-in image, reuse another group's icon, or **Upload your own** (`POST /api/admin/groups/[id]/icon` → normalized by `lib/icon-image.ts`, stored in the public `group-badges` bucket). The image is written to `groups.icon_image` via the normal form save (create *or* edit), so a **brand-new group can set its icon before it's saved** (uploads use a generated storage key). Separate from the optional **emoji** field, `groups.icon`.
- API: `/api/admin/groups` (GET/POST), `/api/admin/groups/[id]` (PATCH/DELETE), `/api/admin/groups/[id]/members` (GET roster / POST add / DELETE remove), `/api/admin/groups/[id]/icon` (POST/DELETE icon image).

**Applicant opt-in (optional):** admins can add a **Group selection** field (`group_select`) to the member application in the Application Builder. The field carries its own list of offered groups in `FieldConfig.options` (group ids; **unset = all groups**, chosen via a checklist in the builder). On submit, picks become `group_members` rows (`source = 'application'`); `/api/apply` re-validates choices against the visible `group_select` fields' configured ids. This governs the **apply form only** — it is a separate gate from the Participate self-service below (which uses the collection's `self_join` flag).

**Member self-service:** approved members can join/leave **opt-in groups** anytime via the **Your Groups** section on `/participate` (`GroupCommitments.tsx` → `GET/POST /api/groups/membership`). A group is offered here when its **collection has Self-join on** (`group_collections.self_join`, migration `044`; a group with no collection is not self-joinable). Self-join is a single **collection-level** toggle in the collection editor, fully **independent** of the collection's **Visible on profile** toggle (`show_on_profile`, profile display only). It's also a **different** gate from the application wizard's `group_select` field (apply form only), and group **`visibility`** (`listed`/`hidden`) does **not** affect this list (that governs the Find-a-group picker only). The offered groups are **grouped under their collection name** (uppercase gold header per collection, ordered by collection `sort_order`, groups by their own `sort_order` within). Toggling calls `router.refresh()` so the Commitments card + stat counts update. If nothing qualifies, the section shows "No opt-in groups are available right now." *(The old per-group "Members can opt in" flag `groups.apply_selectable` is dormant since `044`.)*

**Group visuals on the profile:** each group's icon appears as the circle icon of its **Active Commitments** row — the emoji `icon` if set, else the uploaded `icon_image` (rendered as a circle-filling `<img>`, scaled to crop the wide icon-frame margins), else `✦` (`groupCommitmentMeta` in `lib/groups.ts`). A group's `icon_image` can also be reused as **distinction medal art** (picked in the Distinctions admin builder). The old scattered-badge cluster (`ContributionBadges.tsx`) was removed in the profile refactor.

**Where group membership is read:** member Commitments card, `collection` attunement tasks (membership counts per collection), **derived shift requirements** (a group's `required_shift_type_id`/`required_shift_hours` obligate its members — `lib/shift-attunement.ts`), the members directory, and Admin Overview/Registry — all via `lib/groups.ts` (`getMemberGroups`, `getGroupNamesByUser`). *(The old Personal Schedule `contribution_type` name-matching is retired — the personal schedule now shows the shifts a member actually holds.)*

**Key files:** `app/admin/GroupsManager.tsx`, `app/profile/GroupCommitments.tsx`, `app/profile/CommitmentsSection.tsx`, `app/api/admin/groups/`, `app/api/groups/membership/route.ts`, `lib/groups.ts`, `lib/icon-image.ts`.

### Shared Resources

Coordinates the physical gear members bring to the event (stoves, coolers, tools). Admins author **needs**; members meet them with one-click **claims**. Full spec + non-goals: [shared-resources.md](shared-resources.md); tables (`resource_lists`/`resources`/`resource_claims`, migration `051`) in [database.md](database.md).

- **Admin — `Admin → Manage → Shared Resources` (`ResourcesManager.tsx`, on `/admin` under the Program heading):** create/edit/hide/delete lists (title, description, optional **steward** — a group, department, *or* role, picked from one grouped dropdown; at most one, display context only — migration `052`), add/edit/delete items (name, note, quantity needed, optional **icon** via the shared `AssetImagePicker` — `resources.icon`, migration `055`), per-item progress pill (gold while short, green `✓ n of m` when met) **with claimant names** under each item — the organizer always knows who to chase. A list's `visible` toggle keeps work-in-progress off the member surface.
- **Member — `/participate` → "Bring Something" (`ResourceCommitments.tsx`, anchored `#bring`, above Your Groups):** visible lists (empty ones included — they're offer targets) with per-item progress ("3 of 4 committed"); an **"I'll bring one"** button claims, after which the row shows −/+ steppers (quantities, so three coolers is one claim ×3; stepping to 0 unclaims). Over-fulfillment is allowed — a met need's button recedes but stays active. Toggling calls `router.refresh()` so the profile card updates.
- **Open-ended offers (migration `053`):** each list has a *"Have something that fits? ＋ Offer it"* footer → inline form (name + note) → `POST /api/resources/offers` creates an item with **no target** (`quantity_needed NULL`, `offered_by` = the member) plus the offerer's own ×1 claim. Offer rows show *"Offered by Sam"* (lavender, italic) and others can pile on with normal claims. Stepping your own offer's claim to 0 **retracts the listing** — unless others have claimed, in which case it's communal and stays. Admins see an *offered by* chip and either **edit a target onto it** (turns it into a tracked need, claims intact) or delete noise; leaving "Needed" blank in the item modal likewise authors an admin open callout. No approval queue — an offer is a listing, not a request.
- **Home dashboard:** the **Bring Something widget** (id `resources`, admin-reorderable like any widget) surfaces unmet needs while any exist — see Homepage → Member dashboard.
- **Profile:** each claim renders as a `BRINGING` row on the **Active Commitments** card ("Camping Stove ×2 · Shared Kitchen", with the item's icon when set, via `lib/resources.ts` → `getMemberResourceClaims`) and counts toward the header's Active Commitments stat.
- A claim **is** the confirmation (no pledge→confirm workflow); totals are always derived from claim rows, never stored.

**Key files:** `app/admin/ResourcesManager.tsx`, `app/profile/ResourceCommitments.tsx`, `app/api/admin/resources/`, `app/api/resources/`, `lib/resources.ts`.

### Distinctions

Earned, ceremonial honours shown as engraved medals in the profile's **Cabinet of Distinctions**. The architectural rule is **store facts, not badges** — distinctions are *derived* on every render from member facts + admin rules, never persisted.

- **Facts** (`lib/member-facts.ts`) — `buildMemberFacts({ application, roleInfo, memberGroups, roleApproved })` returns a typed `MemberFacts` object. This pass is **derive-only**: only facts sourceable today are computed — `joined_year`/`years_since_joined` (from `applications.submitted_at`), `designation`/`department` (role join), `group_count`/`groups`, `camped_before`, `has_photo`, `is_approved`. `MEMBER_FACT_CATALOG` describes each fact (key, label, type) so the admin builder can render the right operator/value inputs.
- **Rules** (`lib/distinctions.ts`) — admin-configurable, stored as one JSON string in `page_content.config_distinctions` (mirrors the Attunement Tasks pattern). `parseDistinctions` parses/validates (falling back to `DEFAULT_DISTINCTIONS`); `evaluateDistinctions(facts, rules)` returns the earned medals (enabled rules whose conditions **all** pass). A `DistinctionRule` has a label, optional description (hover tooltip), medal `image` (+ `glyph` emoji fallback), an optional short static **`engraving`** caption (≤`DISTINCTION_ENGRAVING_MAX` = 32 chars, shown under the medal), an optional dynamic `yearFact`, and AND'd `conditions` (`{ fact, op, value }`, ops in `DISTINCTION_OPS`). A condition on an absent/null fact never passes, so rules referencing not-yet-derivable facts (e.g. `camps_attended` for "Glåüm Elder") stay dormant until that fact exists.
- **Admin** — `Admin → Distinctions` (`DistinctionsManager.tsx`, cloned from `AttunementTasksManager`, rendered in `app/admin/configure/page.tsx`): add/edit/reorder/enable rules with debounced autosave to `config_distinctions`. Medal art is chosen via the shared **`AssetImagePicker`** (Distinctions tab first) — a built-in library image, a reused group icon, or an upload; the old emoji-glyph and pasted-URL inputs were removed (glyph remains a render-time fallback only). Each rule also has the optional **engraving** caption field and the year source; conditions use the fact catalog.
- **Defaults** — Founding Member (`joined_year ≤ 2026`), Five Year Attunement (`years_since_joined ≥ 5`), Many Hands (`group_count ≥ 3`), and a dormant Glåüm Elder. So the cabinet populates out of the box.

**Out of scope (deferred):** a member-facts DB migration for facts that aren't derivable yet (`camps_attended`, `years_attended`, `shift_count`, `founder_status`, …). Rules referencing them are defined but stay dormant.

**Key files:** `lib/member-facts.ts`, `lib/distinctions.ts`, `app/profile/CabinetOfDistinctions.tsx`, `app/admin/DistinctionsManager.tsx`, wired in `app/profile/page.tsx` + `app/admin/page.tsx` (`config_distinctions`).

### Asset library & image picker

A shared, growable library of reusable images/icons with one picker component used across the admin. Any admin feature that has an image/icon field uses it: **Distinctions** (badge art), **Departments** (department icon), and **Groups** (group icon).

- **Picker** (`app/admin/AssetImagePicker.tsx`) — a compact trigger (current selection + "Choose/Change image" + Clear) that opens a **modal** grouped into category tabs. The `primaryCategory` tab shows first (Distinctions leads with badges, Departments/Groups lead with icons) but the rest stay browsable. Inside: a thumbnail grid + **Upload your own** (POSTed to the caller's `uploadUrl`). Badge art fills the tile (`fill`); icons use `contain` so tips/edges aren't cropped. Legacy non-image values (e.g. an emoji) render as text in the preview. The community's reusable **group icons** (`groupIconOptions`) show under their own **"Groups" tab** (rendered only when any exist) — kept out of the built-in **Icons** tab so the same art never appears under both. Props: `value`, `onChange`, `uploadUrl`, `groupIconOptions`, `primaryCategory`, `label`.
- **Manifest** (`lib/asset-library.ts`) — `BUILTIN_ASSETS: AssetLibraryItem[]` (`{ id, label, src, kind, category, source, tags }`), `AssetCategory` = `'distinction' | 'icon'`, `ASSET_CATEGORIES` (tab labels) + `orderedCategories(primary)`. Built-in art ships in `public/asset-library/{distinctions|icons}/`. Labels are kept generic (no community names). New built-in icons are appended to `BUILTIN_ASSETS`. (The community's group icons are surfaced in the picker's separate **Groups** tab, **not** merged into the built-in **Icons** category — see the Picker note above.)
- **Two libraries (SaaS direction):** *built-ins* (in code, shared globally) vs *uploads* (per-community). Post–What If, uploads move to a tenant-scoped `asset_library` table merged into the same picker — see [generalizability-log.md](generalizability-log.md).
- **Rendering** — `isImageIcon(icon)` (`lib/icon-src.ts`) decides image-vs-text everywhere an icon renders (matches `/…` built-in paths **and** `https://…` uploads), so uploaded department/group icons show as `<img>`, not raw URLs. Icon uploads normalize onto a standard frame via `lib/icon-image.ts` and live in the `group-badges` bucket under `distinctions/`, `departments/`, and `groups/` prefixes.
- **Adding built-in art (repo change):** run `node scripts/normalize-asset.js <source> <category> <id> "<Label>"` — it trims/centers/encodes a transparent-background emblem into `public/asset-library/…`, then prints a ready-to-paste `BUILTIN_ASSETS` entry. Art convention: gold emblem on transparent, **no baked rim** (the UI frame supplies the ring).
- **Departments** (`DepartmentsManager.tsx`) — the department modal's Icon field uses the picker (`uploadUrl` = `/api/admin/departments/[id]/icon`, `primaryCategory="icon"`); the old emoji text input was replaced. `departments.icon` now holds an image path/URL **or** a legacy emoji, resolved by `isImageIcon` at every render site (DeptRow, SignupSection, CommitmentsSection, the profile role circle, `MemberSignupCard`, `RoleRequestsSection`).

**Key files:** `app/admin/AssetImagePicker.tsx`, `lib/asset-library.ts`, `lib/icon-src.ts`, `public/asset-library/`, `scripts/normalize-asset.js`, `lib/icon-image.ts`; consumed by `DistinctionsManager.tsx`, `DepartmentsManager.tsx`, `GroupsManager.tsx`; upload routes `app/api/admin/{distinctions,departments,groups}/[id]/icon`.

### Notifications

**Admin notifications** (`admin_notifications`): triggered by new applications, volunteer signups, role suggestions.  
**User notifications** (`user_notifications`): triggered by application status changes, role suggestion decisions, and new messages.

User notification `event_type` values and their bell link destinations:

| `event_type` | Bell link |
|---|---|
| `application_approved` | `/profile` |
| `application_rejected` | `/apply` |
| `role_suggestion_approved` | `/profile#role-signup` |
| `role_suggestion_rejected` | `/profile` |
| `role_request_approved` | `/profile` |
| `role_request_rejected` | `/profile#role-signup` |
| `volunteer_approved` | `/profile` |
| `new_message` | `/messages/[senderId]` (or `/messages` if no sender in details) |

Both support:
- Per-item mark-as-read
- Mark all as read
- Delete all (admin only)
